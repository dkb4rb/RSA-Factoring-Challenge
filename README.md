# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

<h2>Background Context</h2>

<p>Before you continue reading, start this song in the background :)</p>

<p>We have sniffed an unsecured network and found numbers that are used to encrypt very important documents. It seems that those numbers are not always generated using large enough prime numbers. Your mission should you choose to accept it, is to factorize these numbers as fast as possible before the target fixes this bug on their server - so that we can decode the encrypted documents.</p>

<p><strong>This project is NOT mandatory</strong> at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won&rsquo;t get hurt if you don&rsquo;t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!</p>
